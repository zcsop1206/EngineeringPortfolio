<div class="hero">

I'm a Mechanical engineering student at the University of Toronto. Current domains I am exploring are bioinspired robotics (specifically tendon-driven continuum robots), biosignal acquisition and processing (sEMGs and EEGs), and optimization techniques. Through my personal projects, course projects, and projects at NeuroTech UofT, I have pursued my career interests in cognitive science, bioengineering and mechatronics. 
<br></br>
My work is primarily driven by curiosity, and this portfolio highlights how my ideas evolve into solutions through design processes. It also reflects on my teamwork experiences, and how my projects shape my career interests.
