# Story
With a relatively open design space and a self directed set of engineering specifications, we decided to scope our design space to advanced hobbyists and beginner professional cinematographers.

We began with a thorough examination of existing state-of-the-art technologies, and found that there was a lack of designs with a shallow learning curve and low cost appropriate for our target user. This process culminated in me creating a standard guided project management framework in google docs: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BdsVr_yOEQF0-ry8fkmVWn26BOyhL2dgDMqzKL2E2LA/edit?gid=20754991#gid=20754991. These system requirement specifications allowed us to ensure specifications were quantified and prescriptive, while also ensuring they were traceable across different phases of the design process.
